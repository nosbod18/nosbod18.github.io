    Hello! My name is Evan Dobson and I am a junior studying Computer Science. I am from Kirkwood, MO which is a suburb of
    St. Louis. I have some very basic experience with web development from a high school class, but I barely remember
    any of it. I want this course to teach me the basics of making a website and provide me the fundamentals to build
    a personal website where I can show my projects and hobbies. I eventually want to use the skills I learn in this class
    to build out my personal website and present it as a project in internship interviews. I think a project that I made
    showcasing other projects of mine is a great way to catch an interviewer's attention. In my free time, I enjoy gaming
    and running.
