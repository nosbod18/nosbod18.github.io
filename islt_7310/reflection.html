            My course career began with CS1050. That was my first introduction to the C programming language, and it's
                where I also fell in love with C. Since then, I have tried out other languages, but none of them felt the
                same as C to me. Looking back at old projects and labs, it's pretty cool to see how far I have come. My
                code quality is much better and my style has evolved to be more consistent. I didn't really know what I was
                getting into when I started the class, but by the end of it I was sure Computer Science was the right major
                for me.</br></br>
            </p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
                Then I had CS2050 and CS3050 in the two next semesters, and those introduced me to algorithms, which I did
                not find as much fun as just plain coding. Solving problems was fun, but finding how much time or memory an
                algorithm would take was tedious at best. At worst it was the most frustrating thing possible because I
                either overlooked some minute detail that completely changed the answer or I couldn't wrap my head around
                the algorithm as a whole and therefore was unable to even begin to figure out its Big-O time complexity.
                CS2050 especially deepened my knowledge of C enough to participate in the TigerHacks hackathon with 3 other
                people from my class. We ended up making a turn based role playing game (RPG) in 48 hours. That was really
                fun and cool to see how I compared to other students in the class (about average).</br></br>

            <h3>
                Here comes the hard part</br></br>
            </h3>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
                Now as a junior I am starting to get into the fun (but in no way easy) classes again. Assembly will probably
                be one of the hardest classes I have taken yet with its hard to read syntax and required understanding of
                the underlying architecture. I am taking a class called Principles of Programming Languages that's super
                cool and one of the most interesting classes I have taken yet, but half our grade is based on a single
                semester long group project of developing our own programming language. On top of all that, I will be using
                a new language called Haskell that is just about the farthest you can get from C. Despite these difficulties,
                I'm sure this semester and next will be the most rewarding and thought provoking semesters I will ever have.</br></br>
            </p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">
                Overall, the experiences I have had so far have lived up to the expectations I got after completing CS1050.
                All the personal projects I have made using the knowledge from these classes have been showcased in internship
                applications and have basically cemented what I want to do in my career after college. I want to use C or
                some other low level language in the industry, although that could change at any time. If I am exposed to a
                really cool and fun language in some future class, I may totally switch gears and focus solely on that language,
                however that hasn't happened yet. I am extremely glad I tried Computer Science that first semester, because
                without it I may still be searching for my passion and slowly be running out of time.</br></br>
