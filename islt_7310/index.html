            Welcome to my website! This is where I put all my projects and other random things about me that you might
            want to look at.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
            I want this website to be an aesthetically pleasing medium to showcase my best projects and my hobbies.
            My goal is to create a beast of a website which looks nice while still being very functional and intuitive.
            I know next to nothing about web development, so I would like to use this website as a place to learn and
            grow my abilities to develop a functional website and set me up to learn more things on my own about
            scripting and different web frameworks to make my website look professional. I also would like to use this
            website to develop my design skills. I am not a very creative person when it comes to design (especially
            websites), and hopefully this website can break through that barrier to let the creative juices flow more
            freely.
