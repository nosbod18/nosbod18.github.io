                Hello! My name is Evan Dobson. I am a junior at Mizzou studying Computer Science. I hope to
                graduate in 2024 with a minor in Mathematics. I have a younger sister named Kira and a dog named
                Marley. I am loving computer science so far, and I hope to do something with it at a company that
                deals with space in the future. The goal is to work for a company like NASA or RocketLab. I love
                anything outdoors, mostly running and backpacking. I am on the Ultimate Frisbee team here at Mizzou
                and it's one of the most fun sports I've played. I've noticed that it seems to be gaining
                popularity as well, which is fantastic! I also enjoy recreational volleyball. A dream of mine is
                to buy a truck and retrofit it with a bed, stove, and more in the back. Then I want to travel the
                country in the truck, visiting national parks for months or even years at a time.</br></br>
                A favorite quote of mine is one by Richard Feymann, “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” I
                have taken this quote to heart with my personal projects as I dive deep into the inner workings of
                every framework I use and each framework they use to try to understand, until I reach the
                foundation of each. I work my way back up through them, figuring out how they work as I go so I
                completely understand how the original framwork functions. It might seem like a lot of work, but
                programming is funny like that. This is the only way I can truely understand the code as if I wrote
                it myself. I tehn use this knowledge to actually write my own version and use that instead.</br></br>
