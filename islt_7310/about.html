                Hello! My name is Evan Dobson and I am a junior studying Computer Science. I am from Kirkwood, MO which is a suburb of
                St. Louis. I have some very basic experience with web development from a high school class, but I barely remember
                any of it.<br/><br/>
                I want this course to teach me the basics of making a website and provide me the fundamentals to build
                a personal website where I can show my projects and hobbies. I eventually want to use the skills I learn in this class
                to build out my personal website and present it as a project in internship interviews. I think a project that I made
                showcasing other projects of mine is a <strong>fantastic</strong> way to impress a potential recruiter.
                In my free time, I enjoy <em>playing frisbee</em>, <em>gaming</em> and <em>running</em>.
